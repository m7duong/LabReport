# Lab Report 3

*Created by: Minh Nhat Duong*

For this lab, I am going to choose a command `grep` and look for 3 *command-line options* for it.

**Syntax:**

`grep [options] pattern [files]`

Here are three options that I choose:

1. **-l**

- Description: Displays list of a filenames only.

* Example 1: I choose "911report" to demonstrate.






2. **-n**






3. **-o""
