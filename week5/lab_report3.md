# Lab Report 3

*Created by: Minh Nhat Duong*

For this lab, I am going to choose a command `grep` and look for 3 *command-line options* for it.

**Syntax:**

`grep [options] pattern [files]`

Here are three options that I choose:

## -l: Displays list of a filenames only.

This is a list of all textfile in directory named "911report"

* *Example 1:*

After we run an example for command-line **-l**, we will have a list of text file that contains a string "good"
